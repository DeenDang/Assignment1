                and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, 
                even when doing so is far from easy. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers 
                but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy

        <h2>>---What do the results of these tests mean for you?---<</h2>
        <p>
            For me, these tests are only for a reference reflecting my personality at this time, but I do think 
            my personality will change over time, thus these tests cannot reflect my actual personalities. 
            But to some degree, these tests can express my personality in a simple/easy understanding way within a short period of time.

        <h2>>---How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?---<</h2>
        <p>
            I don't think it will influence my behaviour in a team, but it will inluence 
            how other teams members feel and how they treat me while during group works. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>>---How should you take this into account when forming a team?---<</h2>

            I woould call myself as a supportive person, which means I join any team with less or even no pressure. 
            When forming a team, I will passively waiting for team to form, I don't mind to join any kind of teams.
