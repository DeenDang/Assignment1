            -- 3D modelling, just started learning, quite fun to play with. (IT related) <br>
            -- 3D printing, just started with 3D modelling, it's really satify to watch printing out the model I have created. (Just a bit expensive)<br>
            -- Coding, learning coding languages like Java, Python, html, php, sql. (Some of them still not very good at it) <br>
            -- Travel, travel around is a great way to enjoy life. (I've already forgot when is the last time I wnet out on a long trip) <br>
