        <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
        
        <h2>>---What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?---<</h2>

        <p>
        I’m really interest in IT with three broad topics, they’re game development, cybersecurity and software development. 
        When I was about 5, 6 years old, it was the first time I’ve ever seen an online game, one of my cousins played in front me 
        and even taught me how to play it. Later in that year, I received the first Nintendo DS, it brought me a deeper feel for video games.
         Time comes to high school, I got interested in coding, having fun in creating basic software in Java. The funning thing was, 
         I hated the English class, thus that was the reason I want to get into software development because it’s easier than English. 
         In nowadays, my thoughts are changing towards cybersecurity, it’s not the game or software development aren’t fun anymore, 
         is because I do think in the current digital info era, cybersecurity is the most important topic in this enormous industry, 
         it’s a tool that could protect myself and other people from many invisible harms.

        <h2>>---Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?---<</h2>

        <p>
        When I was a kid, my cousin showed me an online video game for the first time in my life, and he taught me a lot in playing games. 
        Then, one of my uncles taught me how to use PC as a tool to find useful stuff and surf on the internet (very old word). And also, 
        he taught me some basic components of the PC system, I still could remember that a bunch of wires connecting to some small circuits 
        and stuff that I was know at that time, it had very complex looking inside the case.

        <h2>>---Why did you choose to come RMIT?---<</h2>

        <p>
        I was hearing about RMIT is having some good IT programs from high school news and some ranking lists from the internet, 
        and RMIT is collaborating with the IT industry and companies, which means easy to find a job after graduate :).
