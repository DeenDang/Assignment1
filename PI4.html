        <h1>IT Project Idea: USB that can cleanse your PC's Virus</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The project idea is to create an USB that could cleanse any computer’s virus. 
            This USB contains lots of package of codes that could help you to fix and restore the firewall settings, 
            detect and wipe any virus inside the computer, including trojan horses, overwrite virus, 
            browser hijacker, web scripting virus, etc. This product can also help the user restore 
            their privacy security settings and re-install the windows operating system in necessary. 
            The other purpose of this project idea is to bring up computer users’ privacy security awareness 
            when they’re operating PCs, and help them solve issues that they might face it at any moment. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            In this digital information era, every person is having at least one mobile phone and one 
            computer (PC/laptop), which means if they don’t have enough knowledge of security computing, 
            they will expose into a much danger world net with full of IT viruses. In nowadays, 
            more and more personal computing systems got attacked by hackers, scripters, criminals and 
            others, whether they attack for sensitive data, personal private information, very top secrets, 
            and other important stuff that everyone won’t let people to see.  By creating this product, 
            it will help computer users clean up their systems and bring up the security levels 
            and acknowledge the computing security awareness.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This project idea of antivirus software integrated into an USB needs to have the basic functions, these are divided into: antivirus, anti-virus, upgrade, self-protection, 
            settings and other auxiliary functions, and then implement the software into the USB to achieve the plug-and-play effect. In the actual software application, users usually 
            have different operational needs, such as having to be a quick scan of memory and sensitive system areas, and sometimes the need for a full hard disk scan. In order to meet 
            these needs, usually in the antivirus software to provide three types of scanning: quick scan, full disk scan, custom scan, which is the classic three-button antivirus function. 
            Many antiviruses software at home and abroad have adopted this approach, not to follow the trend, but this design is really practical and really meet the needs of users. 
            Since the virus scan, it is logical that the virus may be scanned. After scanning for viruses, you need to provide the user with the appropriate operational measures, 
            such as removal, automatic removal, ignore, quarantine. Antivirus software, need to come with a virus library, the virus library is the virus signature code **, 
            the strength of the antivirus software performance relies heavily on the virus library. The virus database is very large, usually tens of MB, or even hundreds of MB, 
            because it has to store hundreds of thousands of millions of virus signature code. The latest and most complete virus database is placed on the server side of the network, 
            in order to update the virus database that on the USB in real time, it is necessary to use the download and it will automatically connect with our virus database when using updating function. 
            This is an auxiliary function of antivirus software, but is also essential. Antivirus software requires a certain amount of self-protection or even absolute self-protection 
            to prevent being forced by viruses or other malware to end its own processes. Many viruses and Trojans will fight against antivirus software in order to increase their survival rate. 
            For example, some viruses Trojan horse in operation, will detect whether the system has installed antivirus software, if detected, will try to terminate the antivirus software 
            to facilitate further invasion of the system. At this point, the antivirus software must have sufficient ability to defend itself to confirm that it can defeat the virus. 
            In the use of self-protection features, the need for a variety of considerations, that is, not excessive impact on system performance and stability and also can ensure system security 
            as the best outcome. In addition to the functional aspects, the software interface is also a part that cannot be ignored. For users, with similar basic functions, when choosing a software, 
            the choice is often based on the first sense of the software interface. Interface is not only the artwork, design, the clever use of skills in the programming of the interface to beautify, 
            optimize will also play a very good effect. For example, you can do skinning, dynamic buttons, display effects, and so on. In addition to the specific functions described above, 
            the software also requires the version number, the date of the virus database and other related information of greater concern to users in the interface in a reasonable location to display.  
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            In this project concept, USB will be our physical carrier, and we will consider using both type A and type C interfaces together. Because nowadays, 
            USB is still in the market as the main physical carrier for information storage and data transfer. And because of the antivirus software contained inside, 
            the user can directly plug into the computer system when needed to achieve the antivirus effect, and this will not be paralysed by the antivirus software caused by direct virus attacks.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            When this project is successful, users will only need to purchase this one USB to use when their computer systems are hit and affected by viruses, 
            which will then help them clean up viruses and protect sensitive private information. When users buy this product, the package will come with a booklet that tells users 
            how to improve their information security and protection awareness in an easy-to-understand way. This will achieve the ultimate goal that we want to raise everyone's security awareness, 
            because in this era of information intelligence, information security is more important than ever.
