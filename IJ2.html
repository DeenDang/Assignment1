        <h2>>---A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.---<</h2>
        <p>
        This job is mainly focused on the part of cybersecurity, protect critical assets and information.
         Also, this job is in public sector which means working for government, in my perspective that the government 
         have their own advanced cyber security architectural system that could be different with the companies 
         and organisations that on the market right now, in other words, I want to learn their advanced security system 
         and bring better solutions to help improve it. And I do think the government can produce a better learning environment for these skills & knowledge.
